The number of decimals on the total cast time can be configured.\n    Pushback: If spell casting is delayed (pushback), the delay incurred is shown next to the cast time.\n    Queue Zone and Latency Indicator: Estimates the queue zone in which another spell can be successfully cast while casting (dark red). The queue zone is offset by the current cast latency (shown in red), and adjusted with the client lockout period for maximum accuracy.\n    Global Cooldown: Adds a global cooldown spark that runs along the top edge of the Player Castbar, or on top of a thin transparent bar when the Player Castbar is not visible but the global cooldown is active (typically because of instant cast spells).\n    Swing Timer: Similar to the global cooldown spark, a Swing Timer runs along the bottom edge of the Player Castbar (optional and off by default).\n    Target Name: Show the target name of the spell being cast on the Player Castbar.\n    Channeling Spell: Substitutes the \"Channeling\" text with the name of the actual spell being channelled on the Player Castbar.\n    Channeling Ticks: Displays a vertical tick for each tick of a channeled spell on the Player Castbar for selected channeled spells.\n    Range: Recolors the Player Castbar if the target of the spell moves out of range while casting a spell.\n    Tradeskill Merge: When creating multiple items using a tradeskill, the individual casts will be merged into one single cast, showing the total progress and the time left (in minutes and seconds).\n    Visual Customisation: All Castbars can be resized (width/height), recolored and freely repositioned.\n    Target/Focus: An extra independent and freely movable Target Castbar as well as a Focus Castbar is added, which shows the spell your current target and focus is casting, making it easier to time interrupts, by enabling you to put the castbar in an appropriate place. If the spell cannot be interrupted, the bar appears with a silver shield around it and the bar colour changes to silver.\n    Mirror Timers: Enhances the Mirror Timerbars to allow repositioning and customization of visual options (texture, border, width/height, font, colour) like the normal castbars.\n    Blacklisting Use \"/castbars blacklist <spellname|spellid>\" chat command to add/remove spells from blacklist and \"/castbars blacklist\" to print the current blacklist.

Try out OneButtonConfig to make it easier to reposition visual elements of addons that support ConfigMode.\n    Profile support: By default, all settings are per character, but it is easy to set up profiles for each talent specialization (switches automatically on talent change) or a single profile that can be shared between characters. \n\nCastbars works by modifying the existing Blizzard Castbars and Mirror Timerbars and makes heavy reuse of the existing Blizzard code for driving all frames. This saves memory and reduces the overhead but can lead to problems with other addons that tries to hide the Blizzard frames.

This allows you to more quickly select both the spell to cast, and the target of the spell without requiring an extra click.\n\nTo begin with Clique, open your spellbook and click on the new tab that is shown there. You can also open the configuration GUI by running the /clique slash command. From this binding interface you can add, remove and alter any of your Clique bindings.

You can bind virtually any mouse or keyboard combination to a spell or macro. In it's normal configuration this enables you to use the bindings over your unit frames in order to cast spells directly on that unit. This allows you to more quickly select both the spell to cast, and the target of the spell without requiring an extra click.\n\nTo begin with Clique, open your spellbook and click on the new tab that is shown there. You can also open the configuration GUI by running the /clique slash command. From this binding interface you can add, remove and alter any of your Clique bindings.

Due to popular demand, you can now download Level 1-12 Leveling Guides for WoW Classic for free.\n\nWorld of Warcraft: Classic will be launching August 27th, 2019 and Dugi Guides is now offering full 1-60 Leveling Guides for both Alliance and Horde.\n\nLeveling a WoW Classic character up to the maximum level of 60 is a lot of harder because of non linear questing, no shortcuts (no portals, less flightmasters etc) and tougher quests. Using an in-game leveling guide to for a streamline path to level 60 is again absolutely essential.\n\nWe have updated the Dugi Installer for Windows and Mac to support both WoW Retail and WoW Classic. The Window installer should automatically update and Mac users can download the latest installer from the members area\n\nBecause WoW Classic will not require many patch updates, we are able to offer the guides as a one time purchase of $37 for the complete 1-60 Leveling Guides for Alliance and Horde.\n",

Starting with version 049, Grail includes a loadable on demand addon that records when a quest is complete, and how many times if it is repeatable.",

While killing blows are not the most full or accurate way to sum up an entire PvP encounter, they get us 80% of the way there for 5% of the work. The records tracked are not just Horde vs. Alliance, but all PvP, including Gurubashi Arena and duels.\n\nKaydee is not an addon for only your data, though. Kaydee will also automatically share your data with your friends and guildmates, and theirs with you. This allows you to, for example, see if someone has been killing your friend a lot, and get justice in their stead.",

MobInfo-2 is the continuation of the now abandoned \"MobInfo\" by Dizzarian combined with the original \"MobHealth2\" by Wyv.\n\nMobInfo Tooltip Window\nBy default MobInfo now shows and uses the new MobInfo Tooltip window. On screen there is a movable anchor (click&drag to move it) called \"MI\". Initially you should find it underneath the minimap. Thats where the MobInfo Tooltip appears.\n\nIn the MobInfo options window you can configrue the layout of the MobInfo Tooltip (on the \"Tooltip\" options page). You can also decide to not use it at all and use the normal Gamtooltip instead (this option is on the \"General\" options page).\n\nMobInfo-2 Data Collecting\nMobInfo collects data whenever you fight a Mob. It starts off with an empty database, which fills up automatically the more you fight and play. The data it collects is used for enhancing the game tooltip and the game target frame. It is also available to other AddOns (mostly the mob/target health values). The amount of data that gets recorded is configurable through the MobInfo options dialog.\n\nResistances and Immunities\nMobInfo implementats a considerably simplified method for resistances and immunities tracking. It records for each school of magic the number of spells that have succeeded and the number of spells that were resisted. The resulting percentage is NOT the exact magic resist stat of the mob ! Instead MobInfo attempt to show you a rough but helpful indication of how likely the mob is to resist spells of a specific class of magic. Sidenote: In fact due to WoW limitations it is impossible for an AddOn to calculate the exact magic resist stat.\n\nExtra Information For Game Tooltip\nThe extra information available to show on the game tooltip is:\n\nClass - class of mob\nHealth - current and total health of the mob\nMana - current and total mana of the mob\nDamage - min/max damage range of Mob against you (stored per char)\nDPS - your DPS (damage per second) against the Mob (stored per char)\nKills - number of times you have killed the mob (stored per char)\nTotal Looted - number of times you have looted the mob\nEmpty Loots - number of times you found empty loot on the mob\nXP - actual LAST xp amount you gained from the mob\n<nowiki>#</nowiki> to Level - number of kills of this mob neede to gain a level\nQuality - the quality of items that are dropped by the mob\nCloth drops - the number of times cloth has dropped on the mob\nAvg Coin Drop - average amount of money dropped by the mob\nAvg Item Value - average vendor value of items dropped by mob\nTotal Mob Value - total sum of avg coin drop and avg item value\nLoot Items - all loot items dropped by a Mob can be recorded\nMob Location - the location where you killed a Mob gets recorded and can be shown in the tooltip\nMob Resistances - the mobs magic resistances and immunities\nThere are two modes for displaying the data: normal mode and compact mode. In normal mode one line is added to the tooltip per single data item from the list above. In compact mode two data items will be combined on one line of the tooltip. User of TipBuddy should note that (only) the MobInfo Compact Mode is compatible with the TipBuddy Compact Mode.\n\nNote that MobInfo offers a \"Combined Mode\" where the data of Mobs with the same name that only differ in level gets combined (added up) into one tooltip. This mode can be enabled through the options dialog\n\nTarget Frame Health/Mana Values\nMobInfo can display the numeric and percentage values for your current targets health and mana right on the target frame (formerly known as MobHealth functionality).

If an addon update has changes to the ToC then WoW won't see those changes if it's still running while you update. Those changes to the ToC may include critical things like new files to be loaded. Without those files the addon likely can't even initialize itself correctly resulting in all those errors, mangled UI, etc.",

How many equipment upgrades am I getting per raid night? Am I farming mats efficiently? How much time am I spending fetching my corpse, AFK, and chilling in the faction hub?",

If the shot misses, it sends a different message than the normal one and displays a message on the screen warning the player that the shot missed.\n\n\nDescription\nThis is a light weight mod that replaces the need for a macro to broadcast when a hunter casts tranqilizing shot. Instead of sending a message every time the macro is hit, just casting Tranqilizing Shot normally will send the message, and only when the cast is actually successful to avoid channel spam. If the Tranquilizing Shot misses, it broadcasts a different message. It also displays text on the interface to let the player know the shot missed with out having to monitor the combat log or be looking at the ceiling to see the MISS text over the target's head.\n\nUploaded 2.0 beta version, finally.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n    Tracks casting of Tranquilizing Shot passively. Does not need a special button to append to your UI or macro, works regardless of how Tranquilizing Shot is cast.\n    Broadcasts configurable messages when Tranquilizing Shot hits or misses it's target.\n    Broadcasts message to the chat type of your choice. (chat channel, yell, raid, party, say, emote, whisper, /rs)\n    Displays a configurable message on your screen when you miss.\n    Displays a configurable message on your screen when another hunter in your raid misses, even if they don't have SimpleTranqShot.\n    Play a sound when you or some one in the raid misses Tranquilizing Shot.\n    NEW 1.8 - Displays a configable message on your screen when your tranq shot or anyone in your raid's tranq shot fails.\n    NEW 1.8 - Setup to announce for Magmadar, Death Talon Seether, Flamegor and Chromaggus.\n    NEW 1.8 - Automatically adds any mob who gains frenzy, or from which frenzy is removed from to it's list of known targets to announce for.\n\n\nUsage\nInstall just like any other mod and it does everything else on it's own. It's setup with default messages for the normal cast, miss, and interface display messages which are all configurable.\n\nType /stranq in the console for the options menu.",

If the shot misses, it sends a different message than the normal one and displays a message on the screen warning the player that the shot missed.\n\n\nDescription\nThis is a light weight mod that replaces the need for a macro to broadcast when a hunter casts tranqilizing shot. Instead of sending a message every time the macro is hit, just casting Tranqilizing Shot normally will send the message, and only when the cast is actually successful to avoid channel spam. If the Tranquilizing Shot misses, it broadcasts a different message. It also displays text on the interface to let the player know the shot missed with out having to monitor the combat log or be looking at the ceiling to see the MISS text over the target's head.\n\nUploaded 2.0 beta version, finally.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n    Tracks casting of Tranquilizing Shot passively. Does not need a special button to append to your UI or macro, works regardless of how Tranquilizing Shot is cast.\n    Broadcasts configurable messages when Tranquilizing Shot hits or misses it's target.\n    Broadcasts message to the chat type of your choice. (chat channel, yell, raid, party, say, emote, whisper, /rs)\n    Displays a configurable message on your screen when you miss.\n    Displays a configurable message on your screen when another hunter in your raid misses, even if they don't have SimpleTranqShot.\n    Play a sound when you or some one in the raid misses Tranquilizing Shot.\n    NEW 1.8 - Displays a configable message on your screen when your tranq shot or anyone in your raid's tranq shot fails.\n    NEW 1.8 - Setup to announce for Magmadar, Death Talon Seether, Flamegor and Chromaggus.\n    NEW 1.8 - Automatically adds any mob who gains frenzy, or from which frenzy is removed from to it's list of known targets to announce for.\n\n\nUsage\nInstall just like any other mod and it does everything else on it's own. It's setup with default messages for the normal cast, miss, and interface display messages which are all configurable.\n\nType /stranq in the console for the options menu.",

(it could be rotated by 90°). the 3 buttons are 6 shortcuts to all functions you normally need.\nthe buttons are (leftclick and rightclick):\n1) insta-broadcast / auto-broadcast toggle\n2) tradeDispenser toggle / reset customer-list\n3) open TradeProfiles / open full config-center\n\nYou can even trade for money!!! the customer has to pay equal or more than you have defined in the profiles to get his items.\n\nIf you're running out of items you will trade your last (may incomplete) stack - tD's gonna announce automatically 'no items left, dont trade me again' (or something similar) and disable itself.\n\n\nlast but not least: you can configure all options separated by your char! so it's possible to turn off all frames and functions on your priest or rouge without loosing the functions on your mage.",
